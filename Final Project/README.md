Use Machines & Weapons to your advantage to protect the Reactor against waves of enemies.

### Machines / Weapons:
- Reactor

- Turret
- Turret Maker

### Makers:
Left clicking on a maker consumes some metal and in exchange spawns a Machine/Weapon depending on the type of Maker, the type of Maker is shown in text on top of it, Example: ("Make Power Multiplier", "Make Turret").

### Enemies
Enemies can vary in speed and/or health, they follow a pre set track, they damage any thing too close to them so watch out as damage can only be undone by restarting (Note: currently Machine/Weapon placement is only at fixed locations so this only applies to the Reactor at the end of the track).

### Power Multiplier
The Power Multiplier multiplies the output of the reactor my a fixed amount.

### Selecting Things
Selecting a Enemy, Machine, or Weapon will show some info about it. Just be carefull clicking on makers as it will consume your Metal and make a object depending on the type of Maker.

### Metal
Used to make Turrets and Makers.

### EU (Energy Unit)
Used to power Weapons, if you run out of power your Weapons won't be able to fire at enemies.
